I've always been an analytical person, even as a child I could never just go with the flow. I was the child that sat and thoroughly weighed the pros and cons of any decision. That analytical spirit followed me into adulthood, and today I find myself carrying the title of Digital Sales Analyst in my professional life. 

My job is actually how I became interested in coding. I work a colorful group of sales people and their clients are even more colorful than them; on any given day, I see multiple web pages that clients want their online advertisements to link to. I began to look at their websites and landing pages more thoroughly to see if there were any recommendations for gaining more relevant traffic on their sites; how can their pages encourage potential clients to stick around and learn as much about their products and/or services. This led me to wonder what goes into creating a website. I took a basic, free course online and ever since I've been quite intrigued. 

I'm not an artist by any stretch of the imagination, but I believe that coding provides me the opportunity to create beautiful things...custom beautiful pieces of web art. It is my hope that upon the completion of this program, I'll be able to enter into a role that is surrounded by creativity and authenticity.
